    <p class="about-paragraph"><b>A Disc A Day</b> is a simple music review blog by me, 
    Adam Cameron (link to other life stuff incoming once I have other life stuff to show 
    off). Apart from being a place to practice my writing skills and publish my brief 
    thoughts on what I hope will be many albums from a wide variety of genres, 
    I've also built it to practice my web development skills and I will continue to 
    refactor it and add features to it as time goes on. For those who care about that 
    stuff, A Disc A Day's front end is powered by Next.js and Hygraph provides the back end. 
    Like I said, simple! I hope this blog helps you discover new sounds.</p>
    <div class="upcoming-features">
        <p class="about-paragraph">Some upcoming features include:</p>
        <ul class="about-paragraph">
        <li>• Improved UI</li>
        <li>• Comments on reviews</li>
        <li>• YouTube embeds in reviews so tracks can be listened to while you read my review</li>
        <li>• Probably some kind of rating system, likely a tongue-in-cheek one as I don't really want to say any album is "bad"</li>
        <li>• Whatever else I can think of</li>
        </ul>
