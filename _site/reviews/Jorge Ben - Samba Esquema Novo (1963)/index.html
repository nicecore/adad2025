        <div class="review-content">
            <p>Before the streaming services made us happy to own nothing, but after it was no longer safe to use apps like Napster and Limewire without being a hacker, my preferred way to discover new music circa 2007 was (jump in the time machine with me for a second) through Blogspot &quot;blog rings,&quot; which were basically blogs that maintained associations with each other and promoted each other to help build audiences. Many of those rings centered around ripping and uploading old vinyls with just a short description, the country of origin, and the cover art, and I pretty much owe all of my knowledge of and interest in non-US and -UK music to them. To name a few, there were Vietnamese blogs, Bollywood blogs, and Brazilian blogs, the last of which I would come to spend the most time exploring.</p>
<p>This was the first Brazilian album I downloaded, and I downloaded it based on the cover art and probably just a brief description identifying it as a classic of Brazilian music. I want to pause here and say that if you've never heard this album, stop reading and put it on right now before you continue. It may open a door to the vast universe of Brazilian music, and subsequently the equally if not more vast universe of Spanish language music, as it did for me. This is quite possibly the most important album in my life in terms of my journey of musical discovery.</p>
<p>I'm also going to go ahead and say that for this early review, I'll only really talk in any detail about the first song for two reasons. First of all, this review would get too long for the format in which I'm currently trying to write, and secondly, because this album is so important to me that I know I'll want to revisit it later once my writing skills and musical knowledge have improved.</p>
<p>The opener will be immediately recognizable to most - yes, even Muricans, given they've been around long enough - as it's one of the most beloved and covered songs in popular music history. I probably first heard it in the first Austin Powers movie. I intend to make a list one day of &quot;best album openers of all time,&quot; and &quot;Mas, Que Nada!&quot; will almost certainly make the top 5, if not the top 3.</p>
<p>With &quot;Mas Que Nada!&quot;, Jorge Ben audaciously states that he's about to change Brazilian music forever. Get out of the way, he says, here I come with a brand new samba that you're never going to want to end. And honestly, I don't know of anyone else who has made such an audacious statement in their album one, track one, and then gone on to surpass all expectations in their career and become such a bonafide legend. Jorge Ben would go on to become one of the most important Brazilian musicians of all time, developing a signature fusion of samba, rock, funk, blues, and various other Brazilian genres and traditions that has held me captive for almost two decades now.</p>
<p>There's something simple and pure, yet also insanely complex, about these songs all at the same time. The chord progressions underlying everything are often simple and predictable. The melodies are singable and memorable. But trying to ground yourself rhythmically, if you grew up with the straightforward 4/4 of English-language pop music, can feel like being Frogger trying to cross the 12-lane Katy Freeway in rush hour. What's undeniable, however, is the beauty and emotion in these melodies and vocals, even if you don't understand the lyrics at all (which I didn't for my first couple of years of enjoying Jorge Ben).</p>
<p>Just take my word for it and give it a listen.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: Everything</p>
<p><strong>For Fans Of</strong>: Brazil, Brazilian popular music, vintage sounds, horns and strings, tropical vibes, historic, era-defining albums.</p>
