I'm ashamed to admit I only know a handful of songs by this band and I've always preferred their softer, more ballad-y side, but I figured it was time to give a full listen to what many consider to be their best work. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't disappoint. There's so much going on here, but underlying everything is essentially very groovy hard rock. I love it! In fact, listening to this and reading about the band's origins and evolution is making me want to go through the entire band's discography starting with their debut. In fact, I think I'll do that. This is definitely one of the bands that's worth examining in their entirety starting from the top.

**Highlights:** Kill All Hippies, Accelerator, Swastika Eyes, Keep Your Dreams, I'm 5 Years Ahead of my Time

**For Fans Of:** Primal Scream I guess, Suede, The Stone Roses, Jesus and Mary Chain (kind of)
