Well this is easily my favorite of the first two so far. It is, as James A. Janisse said, everything a horror movie sequel should be. They sound bigger, louder, and more confident. The riffs are bigger and badder. The effects on the vocals and guitars are going even harder. Robert Plant is wearing even tighter jeans and has taken the squawking and shrieking to another level.

There's more experimentation here in terms of effects, psychedelic breakdowns, tempo changes, and mish-mashing song parts together and it's all done to such wonderful effect. They get into it right off the bat with "Whole Lotta Love," another song the lyrics for which they failed to properly attribute and were sued for, but nonetheless, just like track one from their debut, it gives every band member a chance to shine and it's an awesome intro to the album.

I think my favorite Led Zeppelin songs are the ones that are soft and pretty one minute and then suddenly crash through the wall like Kool-Aid Man going OHHHH YEAAAAAH the next, and they grow into that side of themselves beautifully on their second album. What is and What Should Never Be, Ramble On, and Bring It On Home all memorably go there, with Ramble On standing out as one of my favorite Led Zeppelin songs of all time. We get our first, but certainly not our last, dose of classic Led Zep nerdiness with this line that, as a rock-loving nerd myself, actually made me howl with laughter upon hearing it again after forgetting about it for many years:

> 'Twas in the darkest depths of Mordor, I met a girl so fair

Yeah, if the mental image of Robert Plant with his long wavy locks, open blouse, skintight jeans, and magnificent penis bulge mingling with fair maidens on the slopes of Mount Doom and getting cock-blocked by Gollum and Sauron doesn't crack you up, I don't know if I can help you.

The only song that keeps the album from being a 10/10 for me is Living Loving Maid (She's Just A Woman), which for some reason sounds to me like it was written with car commercials in mind and is, according to Wikipedia, about "an older groupie who stalked the band early in their career." I'm not trying to discount anyone's experiences here but one does have to wonder if the fan in question was exhibiting the same behavior as younger, perhaps sexier fans, but since the band found this fan unfuckable, they so strongly wanted nothing to do with her that they felt it necessary to drop a whole ass diss track. I don't know the full story and I'm not gonna dig into it but it comes off as mean-spirited. I will note that Plant and Page apparently distanced themselves from the song, with Page even saying it was his least favorite Led Zep song, though I can't tell whether he meant purely in a musical sense or if it was beyond that. Also, seriously Led Zeppelin, you're judging someone for "knocking back pills?" Anyway, if I found out later she was actually dangerous and made them feel unsafe or something, I'll revisit some of this, but for me it's the lone fail in an otherwise awesome album.

Led Zeppelin II is definitely a masterpiece, even more so than their debut in my humble opinion, and I'm excited to see if they can outdo themselves with their next album, at least for this fan.

**Highlights:** Whole Lotta Love, What Is and What Should Never Be, Thank You, Heartbreaker, Ramble On
