Some might say I shouldn't waste my time reviewing the Grateful Dead's studio albums, but I really think I need to appreciate these and understand what they were trying to do, and the musical evolution of the band as a whole, before I can fully appreciate the live albums. After all, even though the Dead were playing stuff from various eras and genres in their live shows throughout their whole career, I still think their studio albums need to be taken as a kind of statement of "this was where we were as a band." So yes, I am going to review all of their studio albums and comment on them, but eventually I'll highlight a couple of my favorite live albums too.

The Grateful Dead's studio debut is honestly a great little 60s psychedelic rock album and it's a quick listen; it's over before you know it actually. Probably reminds me most of Jefferson Airplane if we're talking bands from the era. Especially on Cold Rain and Snow and Creampuff War, the intensity with which they sing and play is awesome and makes me want to go find live shows where they really stretched those two songs out.

The Grateful Dead was such an interesting band musically. You can tell these guys wanted to be experts and masters of the craft, and they weren't afraid to experiment with all kinds of genres and styles. They're one of those bands you really want to study even if you're not the biggest fan, and that's actually what I hope to do over the next year.

The only lowlight for me here is Good Mornin' Little School Girl, which is tough to listen to in light of the fact that everyone from that era (and probably this one too, who are we kidding) seemed to run around with girls as young as 12 and 13. I know it's a cover, but still. If you weren't down with the sentiments of the song you wouldn't cover it, you know?

That uncomfortable aspect of it aside, I can conclude by saying that if you've always heard about the Dead but were never really a fan, and you want to give them a try, this is a great starting point, and you can look at it as the starting point for the band too.

**Highlights**: Beat It On Down The Line, Cream Puff War, Morning Dew

**For Fans Of**: Pretty much anything
