"Why did it take me so long to listen to this" is a thing I plan to say to myself a lot this year and let this be the official first time. I loved his first album and this one just takes everything up several levels. This guy, Toro y Moi, and Ducktails have definitely been a gateway for me into more groovy, electronic, dance, etc. type music. Just put on headphones and play that first track! Awesome, awesome stuff.

**Highlights**: Heart: Attack, Polish Girl, Fallout, Halogen (I Could Be a Shadow), Suns Irrupt

**For Fans Of**: hard to say due to limited vocabulary on this type of music, but definitely Sufjan Stevens and Toro y Moi
