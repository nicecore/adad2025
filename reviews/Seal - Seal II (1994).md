90s kids know. What do you even say about this classic? I wish I had a new McDonald's Monopoly piece for each time I caught myself singing the iconic opening of "Kiss From a Rose" over the years. Boy was I wrong about some of what he's been saying all this time!

This is definitely a "pop" album but it's also a lot more than that. There are so many things going on here. There are dozens of names in a long list in the album notes simply credited as "musicians." You can hear funk, rock, blues, soul, Eastern mysticism, astral projection, and space travel in this thing. The only noteworthy absence here, well, almost-absence, is the dance element from his first album (the closest we get is "Newborn Friend") but that's not a bad thing at all. I mean you could dance to this. You could do a lot of things to this. Oh yeah, it's a very sexy album too, musically if not so much lyrically, if you, uh, weren't aware.

The musicianship, instrumental hooks, guitar solos, etc. were never the focus of the 90s songwriters but there's some really noteworthy talent accompanying Seal here. Prince and the Revolution's Wendy Melvoin and Lisa Coleman are credited as two of only four "principal musicians," with several dozen aforementioned names credited as "musicians" following them, Jeff Beck, William Orbit, and the prolific 80s producer Trevor Horn to name a few. It's actually not surprising at all to see so many names credited as "musicians" since there's really so much going on in this album musically apart from Seal's iconic voice.

Speaking of which, everything about this album is just so iconic, from the cover art, which later became Seal's logo, to Seal's voice, to the single "Kiss From a Rose" which dominated and defined 90s radio. Seal more than earned the "I" "II" naming scheme a la Led Zeppelin with this masterpiece. I don't think anyone would dispute that Seal's face 100% belongs on 90s Mount Rushmore alongside Alanis Morissette, the Counting Crows, and others we would all fight over in my comment section if I had one (coming soon).

You've probably heard this album before, but maybe it's been a while, so definitely give it a listen. It may be a much needed trip through time and space.

**Highlights:** Bring It On, Prayer for the Dying, Don't Cry, Kiss From...something, what was it? The whole album's a highlight, okay?

**For Fans Of:** Iconic 90s vibes, George Michael, Sting, Sade, space travel
