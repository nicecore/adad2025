            <p>Short review today since I didn’t get one up Friday and didn’t want to let the weekend pass by without doing one. I enjoyed this enough but it needs another listen. A good driving album but alas, I do not drive currently. I loved her earlier work and hadn’t heard from her in a number of years. She is known for eclectic art rock and she is leaning into the eclectic, arty stuff here. A number of the songs have kind of the same beat and a similar spacey, bouncy nature and sort of blend into each other. I am still being a bum and not really listening to the words and I know they are worth listening to with her. Also wondering if the fact that I'm still coming out of a years-long funk is affecting how I receive albums. Greater enthusiasm for all of this must start to trickle back at some point. Track 2, “Moderation” is the definitive highlight for me and I wish the whole album were more like that. Listen to that if you can only be bothered to hear one song off of this.</p>
<p><strong>For Fans Of</strong>: Any weird, eclectic art rock</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: Moderation, Pompeii, Harbour, Wheel</p>
