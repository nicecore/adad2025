This is a hell of a debut album for the band Sade, which is named after its lead singer, who goes by Sade professionally, in case like me you didn't know that. What can I even say about the opener "Smooth Operator," it's an all-time great song and definitely belongs on a list of all-time best "Album One, Track Ones." Seriously a hell of a track one on a debut album.

I read that Sade's middle name "Folusade" means "crowned with wealth" in Yoruba, and that's actually a pretty good metaphor for the sound of this album. Everything about it just sounds luxurious and high-class. You can't help but think of smoky, fancy restaurants in highrises in the 80s. For as sexy as the album sounds though, the lyrics are way more focused on heartbreak and struggle. They can be pretty devastating, as in "Frankie's First Affair," in which Sade seems to be reveling in the suffering of an ex who cheated on her having to reckon with being cheated on himself. The one exception is "Your Love Is King," which is happy, bouncy, and sounds inspired by The Supremes-style R&B but of course through Sade's luxurious, jazzy lens, and it's probably my favorite apart from "Smooth Operator," which can still bury itself in my mind any time it wants.

I'm a huge nerd for mentioning this but this album has to be the most sampled album for vaporwave songs I've come across in my years of loving and listening to this sort of obscure internet musical genre. If you're a big ol' vaporwave geek, every song has a lick or a strum or a vocal line you'll recognize as having been remixed into something else. And that's just this album's impact on one goofy internet music/meme genre; you could probably write a book about its influence on popular music, especially R&B/soul, but pop music in general. There probably is a book out there about it. There's also probably a good case to be made for this as the most influential album of the 1980s. Definitely highly recommended.

**Highlights:** Smooth Operator, Your Love is King, Frankie's First Affair, Sally, Why Can't We Live Together

**For Fans Of:** The 80s, soul, R&B, smoky restaurants at the top of highrises, chillin'
