            <p>I've always thought this was such a great band name, and this guy's albums are always fun because you never know exactly what you're going to get. I remember loving the hell out of one of his first two and he doesn't disappoint here.</p>
<p>This album is definitely more low-key than I remember his others being but there are still various layers of sound to get lost in. The dominant instrument is piano and he makes great use of strings, guitars, and various ambience-building effects. I don't know if this is because it's where I unconsciously want to be, but it sounds like it was recorded from a cozy suburban house in the dead of winter.</p>
<p>The overwhelming tone of the album is melancholic but there are some really pretty pop moments in here too, check out &quot;Mercury&quot; for the best example. My personal favorite on the album is probably the last track, &quot;Helicopter Toy.&quot; I have to say that this one didn't quite grab me like I remember one of his previous ones doing, but he is clearly in top form here and I'll definitely be giving this one another listen because there were several moments where I had to start the song over because I wanted to hear it again. I definitely do not mean this as an insult, but this is the perfect soundtrack to a Minecraft or Subnautica session.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: Rabbit, Prizefighter, Lux Radio Theatre, Trapeze Artist, Mercury, Helicopter Toy</p>
<p><strong>For Fans Of</strong>: Deerhunter, Bon Iver, the Minecraft soundtrack (seriously)</p>
