            <p>I should have started looking at Jimi from the beginning of his career but this was the one Jimi Hendrix Experience (JHE) album to which I'd never given a full listen and I was itching to finally sit down and hear it, so here we are.</p>
<p>This was the last JHE album and Jimi's last official studio album before his tragic death in September 1970. Electric Ladyland is Jimi at the height of his fame and powers. It sounds like the perfect culmination of his early blues influences, his time as a working guitarist on the Chitlin' Circuit, his latter trippy, psychedelic, funky years, and the massive roaming party of friends and musicians he always kept around. It's a musical smorgasbord without feeling incoherent or random: There's blues rock, psychedelic rock, R&amp;B, straight blues, soul, gospel, plenty of noisy noise and effects, and even Beatlesy British Invasion sounds. Jimi is more experimental than ever here without losing your attention for even a second.</p>
<p>This album is pretty phenomenal and the kind of album that rewards repeated listens with many new discoveries (I'm on my third listen today). It's the kind of album that can lead to an appreciation for entire other genres of music from the 60s and beyond. It definitely deserves its place on many &quot;best of all time&quot; lists.</p>
<p><strong>Highlights</strong>: Will be updated</p>
<p><strong>For Fans Of</strong>: Jimi Hendrix, the 60s, space travel, drugs, getting crazy, albums where it's obvious they had tons of people hanging out in the studio</p>
